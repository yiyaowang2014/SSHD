  <description>
    Several kinds of two column key/value data structures, in memory and on  
    disk which sort keys can can be used to implement xdbm partitions.  JDBM
    is one example.  These partition use the same database structure or scheme
    for maintaining LDAP entries and facilitating search operations on them.
    This module contains common tools that could be used to manage aspects  
    common to all xdbm implementations.
